# MATLAB_RobotRealization_ABB-IRB1200
ABB IRB1200 Robot realization on Matlab. User can give joint speed as translation or rotation and can see the robot movements visually.

- You can give speeds for joints as mm/s for each joint.
- You can give common tcp point speed for 2 robots. Cooperating Robots for common load.
- The joint lengths and types are changable. Other manipulators could be added.
